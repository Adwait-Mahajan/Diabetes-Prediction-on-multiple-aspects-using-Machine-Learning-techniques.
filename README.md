# Diabetes-Prediction-on-multiple-aspects-using-Machine-Learning-techniques.
<br>
<br>
Used Machine Learning Techniques to predict Diabetes on two different datasets. 
<br>
The first model makes early prediction of diabetes in the patient using symptoms. 
<br>
The second model predicts diabetes on the basis of the clinical records of the patient. 
The dataset was skewed and Oversampling Technique SMOTE was utilized to get accurate results on the unseen data. 
<br>
A comparison of the predictive models for the prediction of diabetes using the clinical data can be seen in the two jupyter notebooks which have been added to this repository.
